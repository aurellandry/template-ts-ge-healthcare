# Total time & Improvements

In total, I spent a bit more than 5 hours (splitted in two days) on this project. 

Yet, as an improvement I feel the Observer pattern could be suitable here, to handle the clock view and the animations updates for example. If you check the commits, you can see I tried an implementation but I wasn't satisfied so I deleted it.
